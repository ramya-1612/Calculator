# Introduction
In the digital age, calculators are essential tools for performing arithmetic operations quickly and efficiently. This project focuses on creating a basic calculator using fundamental web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal is to develop an interactive interface that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. By leveraging the CSS grid system for layout and JavaScript for functionality, this project demonstrates the practical application of these technologies in building user-friendly web applications.

# Abstract
This project presents the development of a basic calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator features a display screen to show user input and results, along with buttons for numeric values and arithmetic operations. The design employs the CSS grid system for organizing the buttons, while JavaScript handles the logic for operations and user interactions. The project is an excellent exercise for those with basic knowledge of these web technologies, providing a hands-on experience in creating a functional and aesthetically pleasing web tool.

# Definition
A calculator, in the context of this project, is a digital tool designed to perform simple arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It typically includes a display screen that shows the input and the result of the calculation, and a set of buttons representing numbers and mathematical operators. In this project, the calculator is implemented as a web application using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality.

# Conclusion
Creating a basic calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a practical exercise that reinforces understanding of these core web development technologies. Through this project, the implementation of user interfaces, event handling, and logical operations within a web application context is demonstrated. The project successfully achieves its objective by providing a functional calculator that is both visually appealing and easy to use. This exercise serves as a foundational experience for more complex web development projects.

# Result
The result of this project is a fully functional web-based calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations. The calculator interface is user-friendly, with clearly labeled buttons and a responsive display screen. The use of CSS grid ensures a neat and organized layout, while JavaScript effectively manages the operation logic and user interactions. Overall, the project successfully combines HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a simple yet effective tool for performing calculations.
